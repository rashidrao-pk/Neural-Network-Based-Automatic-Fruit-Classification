### a)	IMAGE ACQUISITION
The main stage in any PC vision-based framework is a technique for acquiring the information. Comprising of computerized pictures got from a camera. The system brings the image in digital format. The given image will be resized.
<br> 
### b)	PRE-PROCESSING
When a picture has been procured, pre-handling calculations can be connected to enhance the picture quality. The pre-processing is an improvement of the image data that suppresses unwanted distortions. The pre-processing method in image recognition and edge/boundary detection. It is very difficult to select the corresponding threshold for each image in different application domains.

c)	FEATURE EXTRACTION
Feature detection is an important step in computer vision. Feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values (features) intended to be informative and non-redundant, facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps, and in some cases leading to better human interpretations. Feature extraction is related to dimensionality reduction.
